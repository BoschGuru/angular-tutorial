Angular Tutorial

Let’s start with the first step, where we’ll install the latest version of Angular CLI.

To install angular to your system, please run following command

$ npm install -g @angular/cli

Check the version of you Angular using the command below

$ ng --version

To create new angular project

$ ng new angular-example

The CLI will prompt you a message and ask whether you would like to add Angular routing. Say Yes. 
It'll then ask which stylesheet format you would like to use. Choose CSS.

once installed, please run to check the home page of your application

$ cd angular-example  
$ ng serve

Your Angular web application will be available from the  [http://localhost:4200/] address.

You are now ready for the further step!

Creating new components

Open a new terminal and run the following command:
$ cd angular-example  
$ ng g component home

You’ll see the following output in your terminal:

CREATE src/app/home/home.component.html (19 bytes)  
CREATE src/app/home/home.component.spec.ts (614 bytes)  
CREATE src/app/home/home.component.ts (261 bytes)  
CREATE src/app/home/home.component.css (0 bytes)
